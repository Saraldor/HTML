      <h2>When it starts</h2>
      The Who Shop started on the 1st of December 1984 in a warehouse in Wapping. As well as attending conventions and
      events all over the world, including the likes of San Diego Comic Con, The Who Shop has evolved and regenerated
      over the years into its present incarnation in Upton Park, East London.
      Run by wife and husband team, Alexandra and Kevan, The Who Shop, has been featured on numerous Television
      programmes and news articles.

      With the added TV & Film museum, The Who Shop has become a haven for all things Doctor Who for over the last 30
      years, welcoming visitors from all over the world through their doors.

      When we lost our Wolfe back in March 2010, we thought we would wait until after Christmas and see what turns up at
      Battersea.

      Well fate stepped in when our lovely friend George was working with a young lady on set who worked at an animal
      rescue centre. I said I would look, famous last words. I took one look and he was the new companion.
      <p><b>Bert</b></p>

      Since December 2019 we have had our friend Toby volunteering with us after not seeing him since the mid 90s. Bert
      goes everywhere with him, so we've adopted him as our K9 Companion. He loves everyone and thinks everyone has come
      here to see him, but most of the day he sleeps on the job. it's a hard life!
